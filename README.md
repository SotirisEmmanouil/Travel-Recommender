# Travel-Recommender
A desktop application that collects user input, specifically their preferences on:
<ul>
  <li><b>Temperature</li>
  <li>Region</li>
  <li>Activity</b></li>
  </ul>
 
and outputs a list of locations in Europe that match their preferances. There are also buttons that when clicked on, will open a link to book a hotel room at their desired location. There is also a feature to verify that the user is a human before continuing. 

## This project allowed me to learn more about:
`JTextArea`, `JSlider`, `JComboBox`, `JCheckBox`, `Desktop()`, `URI`, `ImageIcon`, `Color`, `JRadioButton`, `ButtonGroup`, `BorderFactory`
